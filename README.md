# 2D-raycasting
A 2D raycasting project made in Java. Has a source of rays and a circle object which when the rays hit will stop at the circle.
Can move the circle object and sun for greater or lesser shadows.

Need to download all java files for the program to work.
I got the inspiration for this project from this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLRLuczykM
